# matsengrp subagents for Claude Code

[Subagents](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) are a useful feature of Claude Code that save you tokens in your primary context window while providing instructions for a specialized task.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pif98jOScYc) provides a nice introduction.


## Example Uses
