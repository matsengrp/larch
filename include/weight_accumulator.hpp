/**
  Provides a class and templated WeightOps struct for counting the weights of all trees
  in a DAG.

  The WeightAccumulator struct is meant to be used as a parameter to SubtreeWeight.

  This should correctly accumulate weights for any WeightOps for which
  WeightOps::WithinCladeAccumOptimum called on a list containing a single Weight returns
  only that weight, and for which WeightOps::BetweenClades can be decomposed as a
  commutative binary operation on any list of Weights. (TODO this last requirement could
be avoided by another implementation)

  WeightAccumulator expects a WeightOps type with the same data/methods as the following
example:

  struct TreeWeightOps {
  using Weight = size_t;  // Provide any weight type
  inline Weight ComputeLeaf(const MADAG& dag, NodeId node_id);  // The value assigned to
each leaf node inline Weight ComputeEdge(const MADAG& dag, EdgeId edge_id);  // The
value assigned to each edge
  // Describes how to aggregate weights for alternative subtrees below a clade.
  // The returned pair contains the aggregated weight (for example, the optimal
  // one), and a vector containing indices for optimal weights in the input
  // vector. If optimality is undefined, all indices should be returned.
  inline std::pair<Weight, std::vector<size_t>>
  inline Weight BetweenClades(std::vector<Weight>);
  // Describes how to aggregate the weight of a subtree below a node, and the
  // weight of an edge above that node. The edge weight is always the first argument.
  inline Weight AboveNode(Weight edgweight, Weight childnodeweight);
};

  Note that unlike for the template parameter to SubtreeWeight, no
WithinCladeAccumOptimum method is needed, since each child clade in a tree may have only
one descendant edge.
